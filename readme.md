This is my first foray into sharing anything I've written. I have several more functions coming in the near future once I scrub them for anything proprietary.

Set-CWParams will encode the api keys and the company and client IDs to use in the other commands

Get-CWticket will either pull the first 10 tickets or a specific ticket if you provide a number in the optional parameter

Get-CWContact will pull the first 10 contacts

Add-CWCompany will create a new company in ConnectWise manage based on the information you provide in the parameters.


I know that these still need polishing. Any feedback is appreciated.
